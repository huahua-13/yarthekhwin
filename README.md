## Project Overview

**YarTheKhwin** (·Äõ·Ä¨·Äû·ÄÆ·ÄÅ·ÄΩ·ÄÑ·Ä∫) is a comprehensive digital guide to astrology and divination. This project focuses on the rich traditions of Western astrology, providing users with detailed information on zodiac signs, compatibility, and divination practices. While our primary focus is the Western zodiac, the name of our project which means "zodiac" in Burmese is a nod to our unique inclusion of the Burmese 8-animals zodiac, offering a richer, more diverse perspective on astrology.

## Key Features

- **Dating & Compatibility:** Extensive analysis of romantic compatibility between signs and insights into their unique dating styles.
- **Tarot Readings:** An introduction to the art of tarot, with explanations of card meanings and spreads, connecting it to astrological themes and daily tarot.
